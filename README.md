Web link Extracter


This is a set of programs that emulate some of the functions of a Search engine. They
store their data in a SQLITE3 database named &#39;spider.sqlite&#39;. This file can be removed at
any time to restart the Process.

This program crawls a web site and pulls a series of pages into the Database, recording
the links between pages.
